Algorithm Overview:

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a pivotal role in a multitude of biological processes, with aberrant activities being closely associated with a range of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. This invention proposes an innovative geometric deep learning framework, SpatConv, which directly leverages the raw three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of proteins and features extracted from the pre-trained ProtT5 model as inputs, thereby eliminating the need for any precomputed manual features. SpatConv constructs local coordinate systems that adhere to SE(3) equivariance, enabling precise mapping of residue distribution and integration of multi-scale protein features. The use of spatial graph convolution techniques facilitates efficient message passing and feature updating.



1.Run command:：

python SpatConv.py --pdb_file D:\new_try\spatconv\examples\4CPA_A_l.pdb --feature_file D:\new_try\spatconv\examples\4CPA_A_l.h5



2.requirements：

The first input is a PDB file. The second input is a feature file, which is a h5 file containing 1024-dimensional features for each amino acid generated by the pre-trained model ProtT5. Note: If uploading a multi-chain protein, the sequence of each chain of the protein in the pdb file is spliced together to generate the multi-chain sequence pre-training feature. e.g., 6ide_B.h5, 4i8a_AB.h5



3.Reproduction Process：

（1）Run CA_SC.py to package the CA and SC position files for each amino acid.
（2）Run fcm.py to generate the local coordinate system for each amino acid and package the projection information.
（3）After obtaining the 1024-dimensional features for each amino acid through the pre-trained language model, run feature.py to perform feature integration processing.
（4）Run train.py to perform model training and prediction.
